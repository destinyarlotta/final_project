Week 1

This week, I accomplished my goal of having the images of the astrological signs in a circle, adding a starry background, and the description and horoscope text for each astrological sign is written at the bottom of the HTML page. I have begun to add responsiveness to the circle, although I will perfect the responsiveness in Week 3 as outlined.

The greatest difficulty was creating the circular shape for the signs to be placed. I spent several hours searching through Codepen for a usable template only to find SCSS files, and trying to implement code that would not function properly. I ended up getting inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12813573/position-icons-into-circle and http://jsfiddle.net/mD6H6/
and adapting the code to fit my 12 objects instead of the 6 shown.

I am very pleased with the way my icons look. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the astrological sign circles that include the corresponding dates of the sign. I also found the astrological signs vector drawings all within creative commons public domain. The background color of each circle also corresponds with the color of that astrological sign.

Week 2

This week, I have accomplished my goals. When you hover over a sign, it enlarges slightly, and even highlights in a brighter color. On click, it enlarges and brings you to the sign’s page which has its corresponding information. It also links to the two compatibility matches via buttons. When clicking on the button that says “choose a new astrological sign” the app clears saved data and goes back to the home page with the circle icons.

I struggled with the concept of clicking deeper and deeper into the app. I have all of my buttons functioning, but as of right now, I do not have the ability to go from 1 compatibility match to view the other. I was, however, able to show only the description text for compatibility matches and hide the unnecessary information! I am very proud of that. I am very pleased that I have learned how to manipulate hide and show more efficiently and effectively. While I still have work to do with jQuery, at least I learned a lot and will move forward to improve my skills.

Week 3

This week I added responsiveness to the web app, changed the body background color to a light lavender to match my starry background, created a favicon, added a scroll-to-top arrow feature, and changed my buttons for the compatibility match feature so that both matches are viewed at the same time.
I originally planned to have the user click on one compatibility match, read only its description, and then have the option to click to view the other compatibility match's description or click start over and return to the main menu. I found that it is much more efficient and user-friendly if I show both match descriptions at the same time from one button click, and then just always have the option to choose a different astrological sign via a button at the bottom of the page.

I found the scroll-to-top tool from https://html-online.com/articles/dynamic-scroll-back-top-page-button-javascript/. It allows the user to click the arrow and immediately be taken to the top of the webpage. This is very useful when clicking the "choose a new astrological sign" button because then you can click the arrow and be taken back to the top.

I found out how to add the favicon to my Filezilla via this forum. https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?p=73284#p73284.

I ran into complications with the hover feature when in the phone size. It was breaking everything into a non-oval shape until I realized that I could specify the hover image width within the media query. However, I was able to solve all function issues and I have a fully-usable web app due to my work from this week.
