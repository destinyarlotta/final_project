Week 1

This week, I accomplished my goal of having the images of the astrological signs in a circle, adding a starry background, and the description and horoscope text for each astrological sign is written at the bottom of the HTML page. I have begun to add responsiveness to the circle, although I will perfect the responsiveness in Week 3 as outlined.

The greatest difficulty was creating the circular shape for the signs to be placed. I spent several hours searching through Codepen for a usable template only to find SCSS files, and trying to implement code that would not function properly. I ended up getting inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12813573/position-icons-into-circle and http://jsfiddle.net/mD6H6/
and adapting the code to fit my 12 objects instead of the 6 shown.

I am very pleased with the way my icons look. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the astrological sign circles that include the corresponding dates of the sign. I also found the astrological signs vector drawings all within creative commons public domain. The background color of each circle also corresponds with the color of that astrological sign.
